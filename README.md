# ML_CV_model_Quality_PokaYoke
This is a repository for custom projects specific to my workflow by building predictive/regression and computer vision models that can be used for production (manufacturing) for quality assurance. This is focus on changing from legacy method of hand engineered CV and other applications to  using deep learning to identify and minimize defects, and improve/preserve the require level of process monitor by using automation with combination of big Data and the appropriate learning architecture.
